Simulation Waveform





























FIFO Memory Buffer Design and Verification in Verilog

Designed and implemented a 16-byte FIFO memory buffer with read and write functionalities using Verilog.
Developed a comprehensive testbench to initialize, write to, and read from the FIFO, ensuring robust verification of functionality.
Implemented status signals (full and empty) to monitor and prevent overflow and underflow conditions.
Utilized waveform generation for detailed simulation analysis and verification of the FIFO operations.
Demonstrated proficiency in digital design and simulation tools, enhancing hardware development skills.
